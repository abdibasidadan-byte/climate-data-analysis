# climate-data-analysis
This project analyzes climate data, including 2-meter temperature (t2m) and wind components (u, v) from 2003 to 2023, using data science tools like Python, Xarray, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to explore trends, seasonal variations, and produce clear visualizations to demonstrate data analysis skills.
